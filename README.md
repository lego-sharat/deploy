This repository will contain scripts for installing and deploying web backends. It currently supports Mongodb npm and nginx. Going forward the aim is to add more scripts for python django/flask postgresql stack. Also scripts will be added for creating nginx configurations.
This project will try to follow the best practices but isn't intended for large scale projects. It is best suited for hobby and POC/MVP projects. If you are spending too much time doing devops, it is time to switch to docker.
